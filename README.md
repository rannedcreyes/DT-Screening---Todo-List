# DT-Screening---Todo-List
To-Do List Challenge
At first, I didn’t fully understand how this worked. I read the instructions multiple times and watched YouTube tutorials, following along step by step. Of course, I didn’t grasp everything immediately, but I tried to understand it in my own way to build my knowledge.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was adding the delete (×) button. In the tutorials I followed, they used images or icons, but I wanted to achieve it purely through code. So, I researched how to do it myself instead of just copying every step blindly.

Another challenge was understanding the commands and how JavaScript works to connect everything. I didn’t memorize every line of code, but I now understand how it works and how I was able to complete it.

This project may be simple and easy for others, but it took me almost a full day to figure everything out and make it work on my own. I’m really grateful for this task because it made me realize how much I’m interested in web development. It’s going to be a lot to learn, but I’ll do my best to retain all the knowledge I gain from this training.
